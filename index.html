        <img src="Screen Shot 2023-10-19 at 4.06.32 PM.png" alt="I grieve the Palestinian and Israeli lives lost yesterday, today, and every day. I am determined as ever to fight for a just future where everyone can live in peace, without fear and with true freedom, equal rights, and human dignity.
        The path to that future must include lifting the blockade, ending the occupation, and dismantling the apartheid system that creates the suffocating, dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance.
        The failure to recognize the violent reality of living under siege, occupation, and apartheid makes no one safer. No person, no child anywhere should have to suffer or live in fear of violence. We cannot ignore the humanity in each other.
        As long as our country provides billions in unconditional funding to support the apartheid government, this heartbreaking cycle of violence will continue. 
        rep. Rashida Tlaib
